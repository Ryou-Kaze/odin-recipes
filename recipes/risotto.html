        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Risotto, a traditional Italian dish, is renowned for its creamy texture and rich flavor. 
            Made with Arborio rice, it is gently cooked in a savory broth, typically chicken or vegetable,
            which is added gradually to allow the rice to release its natural starches. 
            This creates a velvety consistency that is further enriched with a splash of white wine, 
            a hint of onion, and a generous sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese. 
            Finished with a pat of butter and seasoned to perfection, 
            risotto is a comforting and indulgent dish that pairs well with a variety of ingredients, 
            from simple herbs to luxurious truffles.
